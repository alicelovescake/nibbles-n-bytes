_Four adventurers set out on a mission for 24 cold hours during the dawn of the year 2021. They had no idea what dangers they would face but together their bond grew stronger. Let this be a lesson to any evil wizards lurking in the realm of Tavern!_

**Who are these four adventurers?**

Well it's me and my fellow code loving friends! Together, we participated in **nwHacks 2021**, the [largest hackathon in Western Canada](https://www.nwhacks.io/).

**What the heck did we build?**

We've all had technical interviews to prepare for. It's tough even on the best of days. In the end, success comes from consistency.

So we built Tavern! With Tavern, you don't have to go at it alone. Algorithm challenges are now more like your favorite roleplaying game than interview preparation. Each day your guild unlocks up to 6 algorithm challenges to solve while competing for the top spots on a global leaderboard and opportunities to apply for exclusive job postings!

**Technical challenges?**

We knew we'd be pressed for time during this hackathon. It always comes down to the wire. With only 24 hours to get something off the ground, we utilized [Redwood JS](https://redwoodjs.com/) to help us move fast.

I learned how to build authentication for the first time and it's finicky! I loved trying out [Magic Link](https://magic.link/). It leverages [blockchain technology](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3flqaszoigwis5b/Magic%20Whitepaper.pdf?dl=0) for password-less login. Pretty cool!

**Worth it?**

Heck yeah! This was my first hack in my life. Our team won **Honorable Mention**, a award given to the top 20 projects out of over 200 submitted.

**Ready to check out the cringe- worthy video demo we created?**
