_What if I gave you a million pieces of paper?ðŸ’°_

Think it's worthless? What if I told you that Elon Musk will let you to buy a Tesla with these pieces of paper?

Money, in and of it itself, has no actual value. Yet when it moves from one hand to another, it starts to function as a medium of exchange and a storehouse of wealth.

**What the heck did I build?**

Equitable access and freedom with money is the key to an inclusive economy. Cash App '98 is inspired by modern, 21st century tools like Venmo and Cash App, both part of the fastest growing financial brands in the world, with a combined user base of over 100 million monthly active users. Cash App '98 aims to empower people during the rise of the internet in the 90s, so that everyone can have equal access to opportunity.

**Technical challenges?**

This was my first Java project and I learned a ton about object-oriented programming. From setting a solid foundation with data modeling to ensuring data persistence with serialization to building a graphical user interface to testing and designing, it was a great learning experience!

The biggest challenge was setting up the proper data models and ensuring 100% test code coverage with so many lines of code. But, the hard work in the beginning paid off because it made everything else so much smoother to build.

**Worth it?**

Heck yeah!
