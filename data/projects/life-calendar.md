Have you ever felt like your life is just passing by? A wise man named Ferris once said, "If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it." It's easy to push off important tasks off expecting that there will always be more time. Yet time is our most valuable resource because it's non-renewable. So why do we not pay more attention to the time we have on this beautiful Earth?

Life Calendar is a visualization of your entire life in weeks. All you have to do is enter in your birthday. Every time you open up a new tab in your chrome browser, you will be greeted by an image of your unique life calendar. Like Ferris Bueller, we can all live our lives to the fullest!
