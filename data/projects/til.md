Confession time? I've never had a Twitter account.

Yet, on occasion, I like to lurk in the shadows of AOC's Twitter feed to chuckle at her quick clapbacks.
That said, I am not a fan of social media. I know I'm not the only one who finds myself mindlessly scrolling to distract or numb. Soon enough, [precious time](life-calendar) has gone by and I'm left in a state of emptiness and disconnectedness.

Is there a better way to connect?

If I can create my own social media, there won't be endless scrolling.

- **On TIL, a person can only post a single learning a day.**

I want to curate the information I consume so I can become a better person every day.

- **On TIL, we learn from others, one post at a time.**

I want to feel connected to real people, including their mistakes and fumbles.

- **On TIL, a person can post a failure so we can all celebrate it together.**

I'm excited to get this project built! Have any suggestions?
